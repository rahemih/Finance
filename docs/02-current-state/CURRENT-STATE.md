## Active Task

Task: `FIN-P01-WD-001 — Jurisdiction & compliance matrix`  
Linear: `HOS-114`  
Branch: `research/FIN-P01-WD-001-compliance-jurisdiction-R02`  
Lock: `LOCK-FIN-P01-WD-001-01`

Artifacts:
- `docs/03-research/P01-D-JURISDICTION-COMPLIANCE.md`
- `docs/03-research/p01-d-jurisdiction-compliance.json`

Scope:
- separate market-data licensing from trading authorization;
- representative jurisdiction/regulatory research for Crypto and Forex;
- retail/professional/client-class restrictions;
- provider/broker eligibility checklist;
- Owner jurisdiction as an explicit future Human Gate;
- no personalized legal conclusion.

Owner jurisdiction: UNSET_HUMAN_GATE  
Personalized legal conclusion: NONE  
Production provider: NOT_SELECTED  
Production broker/exchange: NOT_SELECTED

The earlier P01-D branches created before concurrent governance repairs are superseded/non-canonical. R02 is based on the latest clean canonical main after `FIN-P01-WG-001-R01` closure.

## Governance

Active task: `FIN-P01-WD-001`  
Active lock: `LOCK-FIN-P01-WD-001-01`  
Open critical incidents: none

Superseded/unmerged research branches are non-canonical and must not override `main`. Branch Hygiene intentionally does not delete unmerged branches without exact merged-PR proof.

## Next

Validate and merge `FIN-P01-WD-001`. After canonical closure, proceed to P01-E — Cost / Licensing / Data Rights.
